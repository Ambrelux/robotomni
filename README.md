# Project Master 1 : Intrusion detection robot

Simulation environnement for the developpement of algorithms for autonomous robots. 
There are 2 characters in the simulation and an omnidirectional robot. You can control the humans. 
Commands to the robot are received through UDP server and a videoStream for further remote treatment is send to the distant server.

Here is what the simulation looks like finally:
